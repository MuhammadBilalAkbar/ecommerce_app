# ecommerce_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

I developed a Flutter-based an e-commerce app with a product listing page, product details page,
cart management, and checkout functionality, integrating the Fakestore API for product data. The app
features state management using the Provider package, offline support via FlutterSecureStorage for
storing previously fetched products and cart data, and seamless navigation between pages. I
implemented additional features like authentication using Firebase with rememberMe boolean, a search
bar for filtering products, and animations for a polished user experience. Meaningful user
experience, such as loading spinners and snackBar messages messages. I also implemented FCM
notifications. The app follows a scalable architecture, with clean code, efficient API integration,
and offline-first functionality for improved performance.
